# RISC Zero Rust Starter Template

Welcome to the RISC Zero Rust Starter Template! This template is intended to give you a starting point for building a project using the RISC Zero zkVM. Throughout the template (including in this README), you'll find comments labelled `TODO` in places where you'll need to make changes.
To better understand the concepts behind this template, check out our [Structure of a zkVM Application] explainer.

>TODO: Replace this README with a README for your project

>TODO: Verify whether the included `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, and `rust-toolchain` files are appropriate to your project

## Quick Start

First, make sure [rustup](https://rustup.rs) is installed. This project uses a [nightly](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-07-nightly-rust.html) version of [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html). The [`rust-toolchain`](rust-toolchain) file will be used by `cargo` to automatically install the correct version.

To build all methods and execute the method within the zkVM, run the following command:

```
cargo run
```

This is an empty template, and so there is no expected output (until you modify the code).

### Running proofs remotely on Bonsai

*Note: The Bonsai proving service is still in early Alpha; an API key is required for access. [Click here to request access].*

If you have access to the URL and API key to Bonsai you can run your proofs
remotely. To prove in Bonsai mode, invoke `cargo run` with two additional
environment variables:

```
BONSAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY" BONSAI_API_URL="BONSAI_URL" cargo run
```

## How to create a project based on this template

Search this template for the string `TODO`, and make the necessary changes to implement the required feature described by the `TODO` comment. Some of these changes will be complex, and so we have a number of instructional resources to assist you in learning how to write your own code for the RISC Zero zkVM:
 * The [RISC Zero Developer Docs](https://dev.risczero.com/zkvm) is a great place to get started.
 * Example projects are available in the [examples folder](https://github.com/risc0/risc0/tree/main/examples) of this repository.
 * Reference documentation for our Rust crates is available at [docs.rs], including the [RISC Zero zkVM crate](https://docs.rs/risc0-zkvm), the [cargo risczero crate](https://docs.rs/cargo-risczero), the [RISC Zero build crate](https://docs.rs/risc0-build), and others (the full list is available at [https://github.com/risc0/risc0/blob/main/README.md]).
 * Our [main repository](https://www.github.com/risc0/risc0).


## Contributor's Guide
We welcome contributions to documentation and code via PRs and GitHub Issues on our [main repository](http://www.github.com/risc0) or any of our other repositories.
